Todo_r
===

Todo_r is a simple rust command line utility that keeps track of your todo items in code.


### Current support

* Rust or C style comments using `//`
* Only separate line comments are supported. So `statement; // TODO: this` is unsupported.
* Custom TODO tags can searched using the `-t` flag
